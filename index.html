        <h3 id="headline">Outside of his moving lyrics, Layne had some powerful quotes:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "The songs are about things that we were thinking and we wrote ’em down, and when you listen to ’em, whatever you think it’s about… THAT’S what it’s about."
          </li>
          <li>
            "Whatever dramas are going on in my life, I always find that place inside my head where I see myself as the cleanest, tallest, strongest, wisest person that I can be."
          </li>
          <li>
            "I’ve always looked for the perfect life to step into. I’ve taken all the paths to get where I wanted. But no matter where I go, I still come home."
          </li>
          <li>
            "I guess I can go anywhere I want. If only I knew where to go."
          </li>
          <li>
            "There's no huge, deep message in any of the songs. It was just what was going on in my head right then. We had good times, and we had bad times. We recorded a few months of being human."
          </li>
        </ul>
